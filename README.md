# Cython Machine Learning Models

Accelerating the Python Machine Learning Models using Cython and C...

## Database Used

We took the decision to start using Sqlite3 given its small footprint and the
many projects requiere something light enough for being deployed at a distributed
fashion

# Main reasons
We want to implemtn all the necessary tools in Cython and C to practice the idea
of fast protoyping using: 

| Language  |    Why      |
| ----------| ------------|
| Python    |  Fast testing of numerical algorithms | 
| Cython    |  Intemediate Language to improve speed and memory|
| C         |  The final improvements |
