## Synopsis

This is a basic implementation of the Logistic Regression using Metropolis Hastings 

## Code Example

The Example shows the power of MCMC methods to obtain the target distribution that best fit the data 

## Motivation

This project exist as part of the presentation that we gave to the DataLab Community 

## API Reference

There are two main classes:

BasicTools = for static common methods for future implementations

LRSampling = it contains the basic procedures for Metropolis-Hastings

## Tests

The main test is at main_LRSampling.py we believe it is self explanatory.
