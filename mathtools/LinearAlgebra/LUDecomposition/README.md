# Here the routines for Lower Upper decomposition
We implemented these routines in Fortran given their capabilities for numerical applications

## LU Decomposition 

Here is an implementation using Croutâ€™s algorithm, then for storage it returns 
the LU stored in the original matrix and indx the permutations done for getting
the decomposition. And although the result is a permutation matrix of the original one,  it can be recovered by using the indx vector in a backward fashion.

## Backward and Fordward procedures 

These procedures can be used to solve linear systems like the ones that happen
in solving the inverse matrix problem
